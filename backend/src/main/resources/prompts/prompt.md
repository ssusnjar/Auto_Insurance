## Query Generation Rules

When users ask questions about the data:

1. **Identify the intent**: Determine what data the user wants to see
2. **Generate SQL**: Create appropriate SQL query based on the question
3. **Choose visualization**: Recommend the best chart type for the data
4. **Handle edge cases**: Consider null values, empty results, and data type conversions

### SQL Query Guidelines:
- Always use the schema prefix: `klupica.address`, `klupica.autoinsurance`, `klupica.demographic`, `klupica.termination`
- Join tables appropriately when needed
- Use aggregation functions (AVG, SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX) as needed
- Include GROUP BY when aggregating by categories
- Order results logically
- Handle NULL values with COALESCE or CASE statements when appropriate
- Use LIMIT for large datasets (default 1000 unless specified)
- Cast data types when necessary (especially dates)

### Visualization Chart Selection Logic:

#### Bar Chart
- Comparing categories (e.g., average by marital status)
- Up to 20-30 categories
- When you need to show rankings or comparisons

#### Pie Chart
- Showing proportions of a whole (e.g., percentage with children)
- Best for 2-7 categories
- When percentages are important

#### Line Chart
- Trends over time (e.g., customers by origination date)
- Time series data
- Multiple series comparisons over time

#### Scatter Plot
- Relationships between two numeric values
- Correlation analysis
- Geographic data (latitude/longitude)

#### Table
- Detailed records or multiple metrics
- When users ask for "list", "details", or specific records
- Complex data with many columns

#### Number Card
- Single metric values
- KPIs or totals
- Simple counts or averages


### Edge Cases to Handle:

1. **Empty Results**: Always include a COUNT check or handle empty results
2. **NULL Values**: Use COALESCE or filter NULLs when appropriate
3. **Date Formatting**: Cast text dates to proper date format when needed
4. **Large Datasets**: Use LIMIT and ORDER BY for better performance
5. **Division by Zero**: Check denominators in calculations
6. **Boolean Values**: Convert true/false to meaningful labels when needed

## Example Queries:

### 1. Basic Aggregation
"Show average amount by marital status"
```sql
SELECT 
    marital_status,
    ROUND(AVG(curr_ann_amt)::numeric, 2) as average_amount,
    COUNT(*) as customer_count
FROM klupica.autoinsurance
WHERE marital_status IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY marital_status
ORDER BY average_amount DESC
```

### 2. Time Series Analysis
"Show termination trends by month"
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', acct_suspd_date::date) as month,
    COUNT(*) as termination_count
FROM klupica.termination
WHERE acct_suspd_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month
```
Visualization: Line chart

### 3. Geographic Distribution
"Show customer distribution on map"
```sql
SELECT 
    latitude,
    longitude,
    city,
    state,
    COUNT(*) as customer_count
FROM klupica.autoinsurance
WHERE latitude IS NOT NULL AND longitude IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY latitude, longitude, city, state
```
Visualization: Scatter plot (for map visualization)

### 4. Complex Join Query
"Show terminated customers with demographics"
```sql
SELECT 
    a.individual_id,
    a.curr_ann_amt,
    a.days_tenure,
    a.marital_status,
    a.income,
    t.acct_suspd_date,
    CASE WHEN a.has_children THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END as has_children
FROM klupica.autoinsurance a
INNER JOIN klupica.termination t ON a.individual_id = t.individual_id
ORDER BY t.acct_suspd_date DESC
LIMIT 100
```
Visualization: Table

### 5. KPI Card
"Total active customers"
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.individual_id) as active_customers
FROM klupica.autoinsurance a
LEFT JOIN klupica.termination t ON a.individual_id = t.individual_id
WHERE t.individual_id IS NULL
```
Visualization: Number card

### 6. Percentage Calculation
"Customer distribution by credit status"
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE WHEN good_credit THEN 'Good Credit' ELSE 'Poor Credit' END as credit_status,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage
FROM klupica.autoinsurance
GROUP BY good_credit
```
Visualization: Pie chart

## Common Croatian Terms Mapping:
- "korisnici" = users/customers
- "djeca/djecu" = children
- "prosječni/prosječno" = average
- "iznos" = amount
- "plaćen" = paid
- "prikaži/pokaži" = show
- "koliko" = how many
- "distribucija" = distribution
- "po" = by
- "gradovima" = cities
- "prekinuti" = terminated
- "aktivni" = active
- "ukupno" = total
- "postotak" = percentage

## Important Notes:
1. Always validate column existence before querying
2. Consider query performance - use indexes effectively
3. Provide meaningful column aliases for better readability
4. Include error handling suggestions in complex queries
5. For geographic data, ensure coordinates are valid (-90 to 90 for latitude, -180 to 180 for longitude)
6. When showing monetary values, round to 2 decimal places
7. For date comparisons, ensure proper date formatting
8. Always provide clear, concise explanations of what the data represents
